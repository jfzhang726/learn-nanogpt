# these are concepts in parallel computing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface
# DDP terminology: https://hprc.tamu.edu/files/aces_nvidia_jupyterlab.pdf
# A process or a worker:  (interchangeable terms) refers to an instance of the Python program.
#              Each process controls a single, unique GPU. The number of available GPUs for distributed
#              learning dictates the number of processes that are launched by DDP.
# A node or a host: (another set of interchangeable terms) is a physical computer along with
#              all of its hardware components (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, RAM, etc.). Each node is assigned a
#              unique ID.
# WORLD_SIZE: total number of processes participating in training. Processes in the "world" can communicate 
#             with each other. In training, usually each GPU corresponds to one process. 
# RANK: (global rank) the unique ID given to a process, so that other processes know how to 
#             identify a partical process. The process with rank 0 is referred to as the main process. 
# LOCAL_RANK: the unique ID assigned to each process within a node.
# 
# For example, if there are two nodes having two GPUs each:
#       node:    0    |     1
#       RANK: 0,   1,    2,    3
